A TwoSet/music themed discord bot started in honor of Brett's birthday, and hopefully somewhat cohesive by Eddy's. It's got some features but I'm terrible at coding.

### Bubble Tea

- Daily: get a reward once a day
- Bal: Check the amount of bubble tea you have.
- Hangman: guess a composer from a list
- Notereading: shows an image with questionable ledger lines and a note, you've got to identify it.

### Practice

> DISCLAIMER: There's no real rewards for using this commands, despite this being the original (and sole) purpose of the bot.
> That's because everything is subject to abuse, but practice should be a marker for your personal goals in playing your instrument. 

- Log: log some practice minutes, can also add what you've practiced
- Setgoal: Sets a goal for practice
- **[NOT ADDED]** Goals: View your current goals
- **[NOT ADDED]** MeetGoal: Indicate you've accomplished a goal
- **[NOT ADDED]** FinishedGoals: View your finished goals
- **[NOTE ADDED]** Sprint: Start a practice sprint

### Teams

Very much incomplete commands

### TwoSet

- Lingling: Ling Ling already ___ lah!
- TwoSetReddit: Random image post from r/lingling40hrs
- TsMeme: Random GIF from Tenor
- Socials: Posts an ugly embed with TwoSet's social media accounts linked.
