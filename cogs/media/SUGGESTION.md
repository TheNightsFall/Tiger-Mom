# PROPOSAL: Performance Hour
*Presented by: Solar and Nights*

#### Background üéôÔ∏è
One of the biggest problem with the server is that most of the members are old members -- like ourselves, Mark, Han, etc. -- and we're getting too comfortable talking about whatever, even though the overall server is oriented towards TwoSet and music in general. A lot of newer members seem to get confused by the inside jokes, the lack of on-topicness, and in general don't participate much -- nor do we see a lot of new members in the first place. 

So in order to (attempt to) solve this problem, we propose every certain interval of time, with a tentative inclination towards monthly, we have a Performance "Hour". And given that 15NotesASecond has just become a community server, it's probably a good time to take advantage of some of those features to help us do so.

##### Proposed Prerequisites
- [ ] Stage Channel for Performances
- [ ] Text channel for encouragements or general comments on performances, including applause
- [ ] Text channel for announcing order of performances (could be posted by a bot or a person)
- [x] A google account hosting a sign-up form (Fifteennotesasecond@gmail.com)
- [x] Moderators (currently consisting of one Mr. Oppai Dragon)

#### How it would Work

Every once in a while, announce an upcoming performance hour with potential forms expressing interest, potential piece choices, and time availibility. As of now, we're assuming anyone who's willing will be able to perform. After a certain period of time, the form closes and a roster of players and pieces are posted, as well as a few choices in time slots. People can vote on time slots and players can vote on player order. Anyone that wants out can just opt out. 

After a time is agreed upon, and aforementioned time arrives, someone opens the topic as "Performance Hour", then anyone and everyone can enter the stage channel, mostly as audience members, with the players either being speakers or being moved to speakers before their performances. People can choose to perform live or have an audio recording be shared via sound from one of the moderator. No one should unmute and clap during or after the performance in the stage, rather through the text channel. Between performances, one of the moderators could announce the next player, their instrument and experience, performer's notes, and then the piece.

If people are willing, their performances can be recorded and shared after the fact via an unlisted YT vid.

#### Potential Setbacks

The biggest is participation, for a variety of reasons -- the biggest being the time conflicts or they're not confident in performing. And yeah there's no big solution for that besides consistently being nice to all performances, and incentivizing at least coming into the listen the first few times.
